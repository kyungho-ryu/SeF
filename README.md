# SeF : A Secure Fountain Architecture for Lightweight Blockchain Storage


### Summary

Since all nodes in the blockchain have to maintain all blockchain data, nodes with low capacity are more difficult to participate in blockchain consensus. This problem further weakens the decentralization of blockchain. Therefore, we lighten the blockchain by storing the block data as encoded sybols through the LT code.
