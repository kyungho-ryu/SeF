# LT Code-Based Blockchain Data Optimization Project

## Overview
Blockchain networks require all nodes to store all data, which creates a barrier for nodes with limited storage capacity. This hinders decentralization, a core principle of blockchain technology.

This project leverages **LT codes** to convert blockchain data into **encoded symbols** for efficient storage and transmission. By optimizing data handling, we enable more nodes to participate in the network while maintaining data integrity and security.

## Key Features and Objectives
- **Efficient Data Optimization**: Enhance storage and transmission efficiency through LT code-based symbolization of blockchain data.
- **Strengthened Decentralization**: Reduce storage burdens, allowing smaller nodes to join the blockchain network.
- **Malicious Node Detection**: Identify nodes transmitting incorrect data, ensuring data integrity.
- **Optimized Distributed Processing**: Implement functionality to receive, merge, and decode data from multiple nodes.

## Simulation Process

### 1. Encoding Process
LT codes are used to convert blockchain data into symbols, which are then propagated across the network.

#### A. Sending Side
**Encoding Block Data:**
- Converts input block data into encoded symbols based on LT codes.

**Example Output:**
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
    <img src="image1.png" alt="Image 1" width="45%" style="margin-right: 10px;">
    <img src="image2.png" alt="Image 2" width="45%">
</div>

**File Storage:**
- Encoded symbols are stored in the `encoded_symbol_files` directory.

#### B. Receiving Side
**Receiving Symbol Data:**
- Simulates network operations by receiving transmitted symbols from the sending side.

**Example Output:**

**File Storage:**
- Received data is stored in unique folders for each node.

### 2. Decoding Process
The received symbols are used to restore the original data, with additional functionality to detect malicious nodes.

#### A. Decoding Data from Multiple Nodes
**Symbol Integration and Decoding:**
- Combines symbols received from multiple nodes to restore the original block data.
- Decoded data is stored in the `recoveredBlocks` directory.

**Example Output:**

#### B. Malicious Node Detection
**Identifying Invalid Data Sources:**
- Analyzes symbols from each node to verify data integrity.
- Logs malicious nodes and isolates their data.

**Example Output:**
